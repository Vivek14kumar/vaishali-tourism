  history:
    "The Ashokan Pillar in Vaishali is one of the most significant relics of India’s ancient past, dating back to the 3rd century BCE. It was erected by Emperor Ashoka, the Mauryan ruler renowned for his embrace of Buddhism and his efforts to spread the principles of dharma (righteousness), non-violence, and ethical governance across his empire. Vaishali, during that time, was a thriving city of the Lichchhavi Republic, known for its prosperity, trade, and intellectual culture. The city later became an important center for Buddhism and Jainism, attracting monks, scholars, and pilgrims. Ashoka visited Vaishali during his Buddhist pilgrimage and erected the pillar to commemorate his devotion and to promote moral and social values. The pillar is crafted from polished sandstone, showcasing the exceptional craftsmanship of the Mauryan period. At the top, it originally bore an animal capital, most likely a lion, symbolizing power, courage, and the spread of Buddhist teachings. The inscriptions engraved in Brahmi script provide edicts of Ashoka, offering guidance on ethical governance, respect for life, and social harmony. Over the centuries, Vaishali saw the flourishing of Buddhist centers in the 5th century CE, followed by a decline during the medieval period as monasteries and religious structures fell into disuse. In modern times, the pillar has been protected and preserved as a heritage monument by the Archaeological Survey of India, allowing visitors to witness a tangible connection to India’s rich history and cultural legacy. Today, the Ashokan Pillar stands as a symbol of peace, tolerance, and India’s ancient architectural brilliance, attracting historians, tourists, and spiritual seekers alike.",
